As a student of Data Science at Michigan State University, I’ve been exploring ways to document and share my academic journey, technical work, and ongoing learning. This blog serves as a space to reflect on topics in data science, programming, and applied research.

### The Role of Writing in Technical Learning

Writing about technical subjects is not only a way to share knowledge but also a means of deepening understanding. By articulating ideas clearly—whether about a statistical method, a data pipeline, or an algorithm—I reinforce my own grasp of the material.

In future posts, I plan to write about:

- Hands-on experiences with Python, R, and SQL
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques
- Machine learning fundamentals and model evaluation
- Academic coursework, projects, and research opportunities

### Reflections on Starting This Site

Creating a professional website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll has been a valuable experience. It integrates version control, markdown documentation, and basic web publishing—skills that align closely with open science and reproducible research practices.

Here’s a simple code snippet that highlights the type of work I aim to include:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.describe())
