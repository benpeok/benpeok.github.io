Welcome! I’m **Ben Appel**, a Data Science student at **Michigan State University** with a passion for data-driven problem solving, analytics, and real-world applications of machine learning and statistics.

I’m currently developing skills in Python, R, SQL, and statistical modeling, and I enjoy working on projects that combine code, data, and creativity. Whether it's cleaning and visualizing messy datasets or training predictive models, I’m always excited to learn and explore new tools and techniques in the data science world.
